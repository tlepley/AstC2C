This directory contains the reference code of h264 (JM 12.2), which has been slightly modified in order to demonstrate the use of 'ComponentC2C' in the 'C' mode.

The directory holds a h264 encoder (lencod) and decoder (ldecod).


The Makefile of the root directory has 4 main targets:

  - <default> target
    builds two versions of the h264 encoder and decoder in the 'bin' directory:
    + Standard version (lencod, ldecod)
    + 'Componentized' (C mode) version (c2c_lencod, c2c_ldecod)

  - 'test'
     builds the two versions of the h264 encoder and decoder in the 'bin' directory, runs both version on a test video file and checks that both encoded and decoded files are equivalent

  - 'clean'
    cleans temporary build files

  - 'cleanall'
    cleans temporary build files and binary executables
